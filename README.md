## Flagged as virus

If you try downloading one of the releases, Windows Defender will probably (definitely) get rid of it. There's not much I can do at this moment. If you're worried about it being a virus, clone the repo, build it yourself, enjoy! If not, you can allow the .exe in Windows Defender and re-download it. You can even check it with VirusTotal.
